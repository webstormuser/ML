    "\n",
    "                A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical representation of the performance of a binary classification model. It is a plot of the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1 - specificity) for different classification thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "            To create an ROC curve, the classification model is used to make predictions on a set of test data, and the predicted probabilities of the positive class are sorted in descending order. The threshold for classification is then varied from 0 to 1, and at each threshold, the true positive rate and false positive rate are calculated. These rates are then plotted on the y and x-axis, respectively, resulting in an ROC curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "            The ROC curve provides a visual representation of the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate for different classification thresholds. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a commonly used metric to evaluate the overall performance of a binary classification model, with values ranging from 0 to 1. An AUC of 0.5 indicates that the model performs no better than random guessing, while an AUC of 1.0 indicates perfect classification performance.\n",
