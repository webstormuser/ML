    "To find the probability that the total weight of the men on the ship exceeds 18,000, we can use the Central Limit Theorem. According to the Central Limit Theorem, the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables tends to follow a normal distribution, regardless of the distribution of the individual random variables.\n",

    "Let X be the random variable representing the weight of a single man on the ship. We know that E(X) = μ = 170 and σ(X) = σ = 30. The sum of the weights of the 100 men can be represented as S = X₁ + X₂ + ... + X₁₀₀.\n",

    "The expected value of the sum of the weights is E(S) = E(X₁) + E(X₂) + ... + E(X₁₀₀) = 100 * μ = 100 * 170 = 17,000.\n",
