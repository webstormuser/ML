Sometimes when we're comparing distributions we don't care about overall shape, but rather where the distributions lie with regard to one another. Plotting the quantiles side by side can be a useful way of doing this without distracting us with other details that we may not care about.\n",

        "Mean (or average) and median are statistical terms that have a somewhat similar role in terms of understanding the central tendency of a set of statistical scores. While an average has traditionally been a popular measure of a mid-point in a sample, it has the disadvantage of being affected by any single value being too high or too low compared to the rest of the sample. This is why a median is sometimes taken as a better measure of a mid point.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Definition-->  The mean is the arithmetic average of a set of numbers, or distribution. It is the most commonly used measure of central tendency of a set of numbers. The median is described as the numeric value separating the higher half of a sample, a population, or a probability distribution, from the lower half.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Applicability---> The mean is used for normal distributions. \tThe median is generally used for skewed distributions.\n",
        "Relevance to the data set \tThe mean is not a robust tool since it is largely influenced by outliers.The median is better suited for skewed distributions to derive at central tendency since it is much more robust and sensible.\n",
        "\n",
        "* How to calculate---> A mean is computed by adding up all the values and dividing that score by the number of values. \tThe Median is the number found at the exact middle of the set of values. A median can be computed by listing all numbers in ascending order and then locating the number in the centre of that distribution.\n"
