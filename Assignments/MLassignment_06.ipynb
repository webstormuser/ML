A model is usually trained on a dataset, where the goal is to learn the relationships between the features in the data and the target variable. The model is then used to make predictions on new, unseen data.\n",

        "  The average of the K scores is taken as the overall performance of the model. This gives a more robust estimate of the model's performance than using a single train/test split, since it takes into account the variance in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Optionally, standard deviation or variance of the K scores can be calculated to give an idea of how much the performance varies from one iteration to another, which can indicate how well the model generalizes to new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that the choice of K has a significant impact on the results of K-fold cross-validation. In general, a larger value of K will result in a lower variance of the scores, but a higher bias, since the model is trained on fewer samples. On the other hand, a smaller value of K will result in a lower bias but a higher variance, since the model is trained on more samples. In practice, a value of K between 5 and 10 is often used, but the optimal value will depend on the size and structure of the dataset."

This helps to overcome overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.In bagging, each model is trained independently, and the final output is a combination of the predictions of all the models.
