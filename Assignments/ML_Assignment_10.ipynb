    "ANS :The Bayesian interpretation of probability is a mathematical framework for understanding and reasoning about uncertainty. According to this interpretation, probability is a measure of an individual's degree of belief or subjective confidence in a particular event or hypothesis, based on their available evidence or prior knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Bayesian framework, probability is assigned to both the observed data and the unknown parameters of a statistical model. Prior to seeing the data, a prior probability distribution is assigned to the parameters, which represents the individual's beliefs or expectations about the parameters before observing the data. Once the data is observed, the prior probability is updated to a posterior probability distribution, which represents the individual's beliefs or expectations about the parameters after taking the data into account.\n",

    "The Bayesian interpretation of probability is often used in statistical inference, where the goal is to make probabilistic statements about the unknown parameters of a model based on observed data. It allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge and uncertainty in the modeling process, and provides a framework for updating beliefs as new data becomes available."
